==============
 1a
==============

actions:

service_train 
move_[a/b]side          

no restrictions to how many trains can move at the same time

goal state formulations can be done by the "ahead_" derived predicate

==============
 1b 
==============

same actions as 1a but assumes every track is a uniquedistance from the entry track

==============
 1c
==============

same as 1a but instead of "ahead_" for each train the goal state consists of a single
literal named ahead_all

==============
 1d
==============

same as 1a but instead of "ahead_" for each train the goal state consists of only two
literals named "ahead_all" and "serviced_all"

==============
 2
==============

actions:

service_train 
move_[a/b]side          

there are restrictions to how many trains can move at the same time, these can be set
by the numeric_fluents max_concurrent_movements which is a constant

goal state formulations can be done by the "ahead_" derived predicate

==============
 3a
==============

actions:

enter_[a/b]side                 :   after this action the direction of the train is set
exit                            :   can only be done on a parking track, unsets diretion of train
service_train                   :   train must be operated and the driver exits instantly
move_[a/b]side                  :   direction must be set before this movement can happen

there are restrictions to how many trains can move at the same time, these can be set
by the numeric_fluents max_concurrent_movements which is a constant

goal state formulations can be done by the "ahead_" derived predicate

==============
 3b
==============

same as 3a but for unique entry distances

==============
 3c
==============

enter_and_move_[a/b]side        :   after this action the direction of the train is set and the train is moved

same as 3a but enter_[a/b]side is replaced by enter_and_move_[a/b]side

==============
 4a
==============

actions:

enter_and_move_[a/b]side        :   after this action the direction of the train is set and the train is moved
exit                            :   can only be done on a parking track, unsets diretion of train
service_train                   :   train must be operated and the driver exits instantly
move_[a/b]side                  :   direction must be set before this movement can happen
